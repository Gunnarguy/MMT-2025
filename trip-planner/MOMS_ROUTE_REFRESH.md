# Mom's Route Deck

This document is now implemented in `src/components/MomsRouteView.jsx` with data in `src/data/momsRoute.js`.

## If you update the deck

- Keep the narrative tone (warm, flexible, not prescriptive).
- Update content in `momsRoute.js`, not in JSX.
- Preserve the section order: Hero → Warnings → Ribbon → Highlights → Stops → Map → Foliage → Budget → Packing → Alternatives.
- Maintain the tactile, deck-like styling in `styles/moms-route.css`.

## Quick Reminder

`MMTrip.txt` is the source of truth for route guidance and alternatives.
