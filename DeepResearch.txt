Strategic Itinerary Assessment and Regional Analysis: New England & Southern Quebec (Late September 2025)1. Executive Summary and Strategic OverviewThe proposed itinerary—a multi-state, cross-border expedition extending from the historic urban core of Boston, Massachusetts, through the Northern New England interior to the cultural metropolis of Montreal, Quebec, and returning via the Adirondacks of New York or the Berkshires of Massachusetts—represents a classic, high-value "Leaf Peeper" route. However, executing this complex logistical operation during the highly volatile late September transitional window requires precise calibration regarding meteorological realities, biological foliage timelines, and vehicular logistics.The user’s query outlines a desire for a "Girls Trip" involving Mikaela and Tere, with specific interests in "little harbor towns," "pretty fall leaves," "lobsta," and hiking. While the suggested route is geographically sound, the timing (late September) presents a specific challenge: the "chase" for peak foliage must be vertical (elevation-based) rather than purely latitudinal. The coast will remain largely green, while the higher elevations of the White and Green Mountains will be nearing their chromatic apex.The analysis indicates that the itinerary is ambitious but feasible. The primary friction points identified in this comprehensive report include:Foliage Synchronization: Late September is historically too early for peak color in Boston and coastal Maine, necessitating a route that prioritizes the interior mountains for the desired visual payoff.1Traffic Dynamics: The user correctly notes that "fall season is CRAZY." Routes such as the Kancamagus Highway and US Route 1 experience significant congestion. Strategic timing, specifically utilizing mid-week drives and early morning departures, is essential to mitigate delay.3Border Logistics: Crossing into Canada requires specific documentation (passports) and vehicle permissions (insurance cards), details often overlooked by casual road-trippers which can lead to denied entry.5Culinary Expectations: The transition from the rustic seafood shacks of Maine to the sophisticated, Euro-centric gastronomy of Montreal offers a distinct shift that should be leveraged as a core experiential pillar.7This report provides an exhaustive, turn-by-turn breakdown of the route, alternative pathing for maximum scenic return, and a granular analysis of the destination ecology, culture, and logistics.2. Environmental and Meteorological Analysis (Autumn 2025)Understanding the science of the season is critical for managing traveler expectations. The "pretty fall leaves" desired are the result of a complex biological process known as senescence, driven by diminishing daylight and cooling temperatures.2.1 The 2025 Foliage Prediction ModelFoliage is not a fixed calendar event; it is a biological reaction to environmental stress. As days shorten, deciduous trees—specifically the sugar maples (Acer saccharum), red maples (Acer rubrum), and birches—cease the production of chlorophyll. As the green pigment degrades, it reveals the underlying carotenoids (yellows and oranges) and anthocyanins (reds and purples).2For late September 2025, forecasting models indicate a nuanced season heavily influenced by the preceding summer's weather patterns:Northern New England (VT, NH, ME): Peak colors are predicted for the window of September 27th to October 1st. However, forecast models suggest that a "slightly warmer and wetter summer" in 2025 may delay the onset of color slightly beyond the historical average.1Central/Southern New England (MA, Coastal ME): Peak is not expected until October 5th–17th.1 This implies that the Boston and Portland segments of the trip will likely present as predominantly green or "patchy," while the Chelsea, VT, and White Mountains segments will offer the "fiery" display desired.Strategic Implication: The itinerary naturally moves from a "Green/Pre-Peak" zone (Boston) to a "Near Peak" zone (White Mountains/Vermont). To optimize the visual experience, the route must prioritize elevation. The "Color Zone" in late September will be found above 2,000 feet in elevation or north of the 44th parallel.22.2 Weather Profile and Packing ProtocolsLate September in New England is a period of rapid atmospheric transition. Travelers must be prepared for the "Indian Summer" phenomenon, which can bring daytime highs of 75°F (24°C), while nocturnal temperatures in the mountains can drop precipitously to near freezing.CityAverage High (Late Sept)Average Low (Late Sept)Cloud Cover/Precipitation TrendBoston, MA72°F (22°C)55°F (13°C)Moderate humidity; waning thunderstorm activity.8Portland, ME70°F (21°C)50°F (10°C)Coastal breezes induce a wind chill; damp evenings are common.8Burlington, VT70°F (21°C)51°F (11°C)Sharp diurnal temperature variation; inland valley cooling at night.8Montreal, QC63°F (17°C)45°F-50°FCloud cover increases to 44%; significantly cooler than Boston.10Insight: Montreal represents a distinct thermal shift. Average highs drop by nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit compared to Boston, necessitating a wardrobe shift.11Packing Recommendation: Layering is non-negotiable. A "3-in-1" jacket system (waterproof shell + insulating fleece layer) is ideal for hiking in VT/NH. For Montreal, "smart casual" attire is required for dining; the city maintains a more European, fashion-conscious aesthetic than the rugged New England countryside.123. Leg 1: The Coastal Approach (Boston to Portland)3.1 Boston: The LaunchpadDuration: 1-2 NightsWhile the user is familiar with Boston ("City is FULL of history"), for a first-time visitor like Mikaela, the juxtaposition of the colonial and the modern is the primary draw. The arrival logistics at Logan International Airport (BOS) are straightforward, but the city's infrastructure dictates specific behaviors.Logistical Advisory: Boston is notoriously difficult for drivers due to its complex, non-grid street layout (cow paths) and the Big Dig tunnel system. If staying downtown (Back Bay, Seaport, or Beacon Hill), the rental vehicle should remain garaged or, preferably, not rented until the morning of departure. Parking fees in Boston hotels often exceed $50 per night.Actionable Advice: Utilize rideshare or the MBTA (Silver Line) from the airport. Rent the car from a downtown location or return to the airport to pick it up only when ready to drive north.Culinary Note: While "LOBSTA" is the stated goal, Boston is also the gateway to other essential seafood experiences. The "Sacred Cod" is a state symbol for a reason. Visitors should seek out New England Clam Chowder (white, cream-based, never red) and local oysters (Island Creek or Wellfleet) at historic venues like the Union Oyster House (America's oldest restaurant) or modern establishments like Neptune Oyster in the North End.143.2 The Route North: I-95 vs. US Route 1The prompt suggests a drive "up the coast." This requires a deliberate choice between efficiency and scenery.Interstate 95 (I-95): The efficient artery. It is fast, located inland, and visually monotonous, lined with trees that block views of the ocean.US Route 1 (The Coastal Route): This is the "harbor town" route desired. It threads through the historic centers of Newburyport, Portsmouth, and the Maine beaches.Recommendation: Take I-95 North to Newburyport, MA, then switch to local roads or Route 1 to hug the coast through New Hampshire (Portsmouth) and into Maine (Kittery/York/Ogunquit). This adds approximately 90 minutes to the drive but delivers the requested aesthetic.153.3 Deep Dive: The Lobster Shack EcosystemThe user specifically requested insights on "eating Lobster" and "little harbor towns." The stretch of coast between Kittery, ME, and Portland, ME, is arguably the global epicenter of the rustic lobster shack. Understanding the nuances of these establishments elevates the dining experience from a meal to a cultural event.Top Tier Recommendations based on Route:EstablishmentLocationAtmosphere & LogisticsThe Culinary ProductChauncey Creek Lobster PierKittery Point, MERustic & Social. Located on a brightly painted pier literally over the tidal creek. Key Insight: BYOB. It is legal to bring your own wine/beer here. Visitors can stop at a local Kittery wine shop, bring a tablecloth and candles, and create a high-end dining experience on a picnic table.16Boiled whole lobster, steamers (clams), mussels. The experience is "in the rough"—messy, authentic, and memorable.The Clam ShackKennebunkport, MEIconic & Bustling. A tiny shack located on the bridge in the middle of Dock Square. Expect a line. It is a high-energy, tourist-heavy location.The Award-Winner. Famous for a specific lobster roll style using a round bakery bun (burger style) rather than the split-top hot dog bun. They use fresh picked meat, butter, and a little mayo (optional).18McLoons Lobster ShackSouth Thomaston, MEScenic Perfection. Note: Located 1.5 hours north of Portland. If the itinerary allows a day trip north, this is the "postcard" standard—red shack, working wharf, spruce trees, and silence.17"Lobster Rolls Royce" (extra meat). Half-and-half rolls. This is for the purist willing to drive for the view.Insight on Pricing: Lobster is a commodity. Prices at these shacks fluctuate daily based on the catch ("Market Price"). In late September, hard-shell lobsters are prevalent, which are fuller with meat than the summer soft-shells, but slightly harder to crack.163.4 Harbor Town Analysis: Ogunquit vs. KennebunkportThe drive from Boston to Portland passes two major "harbor town" candidates. While both are quintessentially "New England," they offer distinct vibes.Ogunquit, ME:The Draw: Features the Marginal Way, a mile-long paved cliff walk overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. This aligns perfectly with the user's "walking/hiking" desire without requiring rugged gear.21The Harbor: Perkins Cove is a tiny, manually operated drawbridge harbor that feels like a movie set. It is pedestrian-focused and artistically inclined (historically an artist colony).Parking Strategy: Park at the Obed's Lot (north end) and walk the Marginal Way south to Perkins Cove, then take the trolley back, or park at Perkins Cove (very limited spaces).21Kennebunkport, ME:The Draw: Wealth, history, and shopping. Famous for the Bush estate (Walker's Point). Dock Square is excellent for high-end boutiques and galleries.The Vibe: The atmosphere is "preppy resort" and polished, contrasting with Ogunquit's slightly more bohemian "beach town" feel.23Strategic Stop Recommendation: Stop in Ogunquit for the Marginal Way walk (approx. 1 hour) to stretch legs and see the ocean cliffs, then proceed to Kennebunkport for a late lunch at The Clam Shack before arriving in Portland.3.5 Portland, MaineDuration: 1 NightPortland has evolved from a gritty port into a foodie heavyweight, boasting one of the highest concentrations of restaurants per capita in the US.The Vibe: Working waterfront meets hipster gentrification. Cobblestone streets in the "Old Port" district are lined with brick warehouses converted into boutiques and bars.Must-Do: Visit Portland Head Light (in nearby Cape Elizabeth)—this is the most photographed lighthouse in America and quintessential "New England".22 The adjacent Fort Williams Park offers walking trails with ocean views.Dining: If the group tires of boiled lobster, seek out high-end seafood at places like Eventide Oyster Co. (famous for a brown-butter lobster bun that redefines the genre) or Duckfat (known for fries and poutine).254. Leg 2: The Inland Traverse (Portland to Chelsea, VT)This segment presents the highest risk of "boring driving" if the wrong route is chosen. The user suggested driving via Concord, NH.Critical Correction:The Concord Route: Taking Route 202 or Route 4 to Concord, NH, and then I-89 to VT is efficient but scenically inferior. It bypasses the geological heart of the region. Concord is a functional state capital, not a primary tourist destination.26The Scenic Alternative (Highly Recommended): Drive North from Portland to North Conway, NH, and take Route 112 (The Kancamagus Highway) across the White Mountains. This adds minimal time but infinite scenic value.274.1 The Kancamagus Highway ("The Kanc")This 34-mile stretch of National Scenic Byway is the "Holy Grail" of New England leaf-peeping. It cuts through the White Mountain National Forest with no gas stations, no hotels, and no businesses—just mountains, river, and asphalt.29Traffic Warning: In late September/early October, this road can become a parking lot due to volume.Mitigation Strategy: Depart Portland early (by 8:00 AM). Enter the highway from the Conway side (East) heading West. This puts the sun behind the vehicle for better viewing and often goes against the primary flow of traffic coming up from Boston/I-93.3Key Stops on The Kanc (East to West):Stop NameActivity TypeDescriptionAlbany Covered BridgePhotography/HistoryA classic rustic bridge over the Swift River. Iconic photo op located just off the highway.31Lower FallsRecreationEasy access to the river. Great for hopping on sun-warmed granite boulders in the riverbed.33Rocky GorgeScenic ViewA dramatic narrow gorge where the river churns violently. There is a footbridge here offering excellent views.34Sabbaday FallsHiking (Easy)Crucial Stop. A short, easy hike (gravel path) leads to a stunning multi-tiered waterfall in a glacial flume. This fulfills the "stop and hike wherever" request.29Hancock OverlookVistaA hairpin turn with a sweeping view of the Osceola Range. This is where the foliage will be most advanced (reds/purples) due to elevation.314.2 Arrival in Chelsea, VTAfter exiting the Kancamagus in Lincoln, NH, the route takes I-91 into Vermont. Chelsea is a quintessential, isolated Vermont village.Context: Chelsea is not a tourist hub like Stowe. It is authentic, rural Vermont. It features two village greens, a courthouse, and unpaved back roads."Sally's Property": Without knowing the specific property, the activity here is likely Agritourism or rural relaxation. Expect silence, stargazing (due to very low light pollution), and "unimproved" hiking on logging roads or deer trails.Leaf Status: By late September, Chelsea (Central VT) will be nearing peak. The sugar maples here produce the vibrant oranges and yellows associated with the Green Mountain State.25. Leg 3: The Northern Corridor (Vermont to Montreal)5.1 The Route: Chelsea to BurlingtonThe drive from Chelsea to Burlington navigates the heart of the Green Mountains.Stop: Montpelier: The smallest state capital in the US. It is worth a 30-minute stop to see the gold-domed state house and grab a "creemee" (Vermont soft-serve ice cream, ideally maple flavored).Stop: Waterbury/Stowe: Just off I-89. This area is often called the "Napa Valley of Ice Cream."Ben & Jerry’s Factory: A major tourist attraction. Tours are available, and the "Flavor Graveyard" is a whimsical stop.36Cold Hollow Cider Mill: Essential for fresh cider donuts. This is a high-traffic stop but moves quickly.36Smugglers' Notch: If time permits, the drive through the Notch (Route 108) is dramatic, with 1,000-foot cliffs on either side, though it may be congested with leaf-peepers.365.2 Burlington, VTDuration: "Just a stopping place"Burlington sits on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain.Activity: Walk Church Street Marketplace (pedestrian mall). It is vibrant, lined with historic brick buildings, buskers, and local shops.37Scenic: Head to the waterfront park. The view across the lake to the Adirondack Mountains (NY) is spectacular, especially at sunset. This offers a preview of the return journey's landscape.5.3 The Border Crossing (High Friction Potential)Crossing from VT (Highgate Springs) into Quebec (St-Armand) is a serious international border. Casual preparation can lead to delays or denied entry.Documentation Requirements:Passports: US Citizens MUST have a valid passport. While technically some land borders may accept Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDL), a passport is the only risk-free document. A standard driver's license is not sufficient.38The "6-Month Rule": While Canada generally allows entry as long as the passport is valid for the duration of stay, airlines or specific agents may enforce a guideline requiring validity for 6 months beyond the date of travel. It is safest to ensure passports do not expire before early 2026.39Vehicle Restrictions:Rental Car Authorization: If driving a rental car, the user must inspect the rental agreement. Some US rental agencies prohibit crossing international borders or require a "Non-Resident Insurance Card" (Canada Non-Resident Card) which proves liability coverage in Canada.5Action Item: Call the rental agency now to authorize travel to Canada. Failure to do so can result in the car being impounded or insurance being voided in the event of an accident.6Inadmissibility Rules:DUI: Canada has strict laws regarding "Driving Under the Influence." Any traveler with a DUI conviction on their record (even from decades ago) may be deemed "criminally inadmissible" and denied entry at the border.5.4 The "Dull" Drive to MontrealThe user should be warned: The drive from the border to Montreal (approx. 1 hour) is geographically flat and visually uninspiring (cornfields, silos) compared to the mountains of Vermont. It is known as the St. Lawrence Lowlands.43 Do not be discouraged; the scenic payoff is the city itself.6. Leg 4: Montreal (The Cultural Apex)Duration: 2 NightsMontreal is the most "foreign" city in North America. It offers a distinct French culture, architecture, and attitude. Late September weather is significantly cooler here (jacket required), marking the transition to the northern climate zone.106.1 Neighborhood Strategy: Old Montreal vs. The PlateauFor a "Girls' Trip," the choice of neighborhood dictates the experience.Old Montreal (Vieux-Montréal):The Vibe: Cobblestone streets, horse-drawn carriages, the Old Port. It is incredibly photogenic but highly touristy and expensive. It feels like a sanitized version of Europe.Best for: First-time sightseeing, luxury hotels, proximity to Notre Dame Basilica.45Plateau Mont-Royal / Mile End:The Vibe: The "cool" Montreal. Famous for winding outdoor staircases, colorful murals, and an intense density of BYOB restaurants and cafes.Best for: "Vibes," foodies, walking, and feeling like a local rather than a tourist.46Recommendation: Stay in Old Montreal for the "romance" and architecture (walking distance to the Basilica), but spend the days exploring the Plateau to capture the city's living culture.6.2 Culinary Itinerary (Non-Negotiable)Montreal food is a trinity: Bagels, Smoked Meat, Poutine.Bagels: Montreal bagels are distinct from New York bagels. They are boiled in honey water and baked in wood-fired ovens, resulting in a denser, sweeter product.The Rivalry: St-Viateur vs. Fairmount. They are located blocks apart. Mikaela should buy a hot dozen from St-Viateur (open 24 hours) and eat them on the street to experience the true texture.7Smoked Meat: Schwartz’s Deli on St-Laurent. This is an institution. There is always a line. The meat is brisket cured for 10 days. Order "medium-fat" for the authentic experience.7Poutine: La Banquise (open 24 hours). While poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy) is available everywhere, La Banquise offers countless varieties and is a cultural landmark. It is a heavy meal, best shared or eaten late at night.48Fine Dining: For the "Girls' Trip" celebration, consider Le Serpent (industrial chic, Italian) or Monarque (Old Montreal brasserie, very high quality). Avoid the restaurants on "Place Jacques-Cartier" with picture menus; they are generally tourist traps.506.3 Cultural HighlightsAura at Notre-Dame Basilica: This is not a standard church tour. It is a light and sound show projected onto the interior architecture of the basilica. It is immersive, moving, and highlights the neo-Gothic details in a modern way. Tickets must be booked in advance as it sells out.52Mount Royal Park: A "hike" right in the city. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted (who also designed Central Park in NYC). The view from the Kondiaronk Belvedere at the top offers the definitive skyline photo.477. Leg 5: The Fork in the Road (The Return)The user asks to choose between New York (Saratoga) or Massachusetts (Stockbridge).Option A: The Adirondack Route (Montreal -> Saratoga -> Albany)The Drive: Taking I-87 South crosses the Adirondack Park. This is a massive protected area, larger than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier, and Grand Canyon combined.Lake Placid: Host of two Winter Olympics (1932, 1980).Whiteface Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway: A toll road that allows visitors to drive nearly to the summit of the 5th highest peak in NY.Status: It typically closes for the season in mid-October. Late September is the perfect and often final window to access these panoramic views.54Foliage: The Adirondacks turn early. Late September is often peak here, likely more vibrant than the coast.56Saratoga Springs:Status: The famous horse racing season ends Labor Day. In late September, the town enters "Dark Days"—it is quiet, sophisticated, and relaxed.Activity: Walk Broadway (great shops), visit Yaddo Gardens (historic rose gardens), or soak in the mineral springs at Saratoga Spa State Park.58Why choose this: Better mountain scenery (Adirondacks are rugged), sophisticated walkable town (Saratoga), and closer to the Albany airport.Option B: The Berkshires Route (Montreal -> Albany -> Stockbridge -> Boston)The Drive: This route requires driving further east/south.Stockbridge:Norman Rockwell Museum: Essential American art history.The Vibe: "Gilded Age" estates, manicured lawns, very wealthy and quiet.Hiking: The user mentioned Ice Glen and Laura’s Tower. These are excellent, moderate hikes. Ice Glen is a ravine that retains ice into summer due to its geography; Laura’s Tower offers a view of three states.Why choose this: If the flight must be out of Boston, or if the group prefers "pastoral/cultural" scenery over "rugged mountain" scenery.Strategic Recommendation: Choose Option A (Saratoga/Albany).Reasoning: Flying out of Albany saves the drive back to Boston (reducing traffic risk). The drive through the Adirondacks (I-87) in late September is one of the most beautiful interstate drives in America due to foliage timing. Saratoga offers a great "last night" luxury feel (spas, fine dining) before flying out.8. Detailed Day-by-Day Itinerary ConstructionDay 1: Arrival & ImmersionLocation: Boston, MA.Activity: Arrive Logan Airport. Check into hotel (Back Bay or Seaport recommended).Dinner: Neptune Oyster (North End) for hot buttered lobster rolls, or Union Oyster House (oldest restaurant in US) for history.Transport: Taxi/Uber. Do not rent car yet to save parking fees.Day 2: The CoastLogistics: Pick up Rental Car (ensure Canada authorization). Depart Boston by 9:00 AM.Stop 1 (10:30 AM): Kittery/Ogunquit. Walk the Marginal Way.21Lunch (12:30 PM): Chauncey Creek Lobster Pier (Kittery) or The Clam Shack (Kennebunkport).16Afternoon: Explore Portland Head Light (Cape Elizabeth).Overnight: Portland, ME (Old Port district).Day 3: The MountainsLogistics: Depart Portland 8:30 AM. Drive Route 302 to North Conway, then Route 112 (Kancamagus Highway).Activity: Drive "The Kanc." Stops: Albany Covered Bridge, Sabbaday Falls hike (1 hour), Hancock Overlook.29Lunch: Picnic on the rocks at Lower Falls or a sandwich in Lincoln, NH.Drive: I-91 to Chelsea, VT.Overnight: Chelsea, VT ("Sally's").Day 4: The Green Mountains & BorderMorning: Enjoy the property in Chelsea. Slow start.Lunch: Montpelier or Waterbury (Ben & Jerry's/Cider Donuts).Afternoon: Drive to Burlington. Walk Church Street.Late Afternoon: Drive to Montreal. Border crossing (Highgate Springs).Overnight: Old Montreal.Day 5: Montreal CultureMorning: Bagel crawl in Mile End (St-Viateur). Walk up Mount Royal.47Lunch: Smoked Meat at Schwartz's.Afternoon: Explore Old Montreal shops.Evening: Aura Light Show at Notre Dame Basilica.52Dinner: Fine dining in Old Montreal or Plateau.Day 6: The Return (Adirondacks)Logistics: Depart Montreal. Cross border back to US (I-87).Drive: Through Adirondack Park.Stop: Lake Placid. Drive Whiteface Veterans Memorial Highway (weather permitting).54Late Afternoon: Arrive Saratoga Springs.Dinner: Downtown Saratoga (Broadway).Overnight: Saratoga Springs.Day 7: DepartureMorning: Coffee in Saratoga.Logistics: Drive to Albany International Airport (ALB) - approx. 30 mins. Drop rental car. Fly home.9. Financial and Logistical Contingencies9.1 The One-Way Rental FeeDropping a car in Albany that was rented in Boston triggers a "One-Way Drop Fee."Cost Analysis: This fee can range from $100 to $500 depending on the agency and inventory levels.60Action: Compare "Round Trip Boston" vs. "One-Way Albany" when booking. If the fee is excessive ($300+), it might be worth driving back to Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), but this adds 3 hours of driving and stress. For a premium trip, the fee is usually worth the convenience.9.2 Alternative Trips (User Query: Carolinas/West Coast?)The user asked about alternatives.Carolinas (Blue Ridge Parkway): Foliage here peaks much later (mid-to-late October).62 A late September trip to Asheville/Smoky Mountains will be green.West Coast: Pacific Coast Highway is spectacular, but "fall foliage" is less dramatic than New England (mostly golden aspens vs. the red maples of the East).Conclusion: For "pretty fall leaves" in Late September, Northern New England is the scientifically correct choice.9.3 Traffic Reality CheckThe user worries about "serious traffic."Analysis:I-95/Route 1 (ME): Heavy on weekends. Weekdays are manageable.Kancamagus Highway (NH): Heavy during midday (11 AM - 3 PM). Early morning is clear.Border: Can have 1+ hour waits on Friday afternoons or Sunday evenings. Crossing mid-week is usually fast (15-20 mins).Leaf Peeping Crowds: The "Leaf Peeper" invasion is real, but it is concentrated in "famous" towns (Stowe, North Conway). Chelsea, VT, and the drive through the Adirondacks will be quieter.10. Final RecommendationProceed with the Boston -> Portland -> Kancamagus -> Chelsea -> Montreal -> Saratoga -> Albany route. It maximizes foliage potential by hitting high elevations in NH/NY, satisfies the "Lobster" and "Harbor Town" requirement early, delivers the "Hiking" requirement in the White Mountains, and ends with a culturally distinct city experience. It balances the rustic (Chelsea) with the sophisticated (Montreal/Saratoga) perfectly for a mixed-generation "Girls' Trip."
