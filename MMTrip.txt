Girls Trip to New England
This is ONLY mapped out for the drive.  
It’s a SUGGESTED ROUTE! 
I tried to hit places that I know to be interesting or a good place to stay.  
If we go in late September, we could face some serious traffic.  
It’s all over the news that fall season is CRAZY for leaf-peeping.  
There is so much to do outdoors in these states, and we can stop and hike wherever.
Don’t be afraid to change anything. It may be too ambitious… Below are some notes:
--Begin in Boston—1-2 nights
Use the arrival day and perhaps next day for touring the city and eating some LOBSTA!  The city is FULL of history, of course.
--Drive up the coast to Portland, ME 2 hrs drive—stay 1 night
--Drive to Chelsea, VT (via Concord, NH) 3 ½ hrs total drive—stay 1-2 nights
I thought we could stay a night at Sally’s in Chelsea (I have no real plans for Concord, it could just be a stopping place on the way).  We can do some serious walking/hiking just on Sally’s property alone.
--Drive to Montreal (via Burlington VT) 2 ½ hrs drive—stay 2 nights
	No specific plans for Burlington, just a nice stopping place, some hiking?
	Explore Montreal


Or continue on to:

--Drive to Saratoga Springs, NY (via Lake Placid) 4 hrs total drive—stay 1 night
--Drive to Stockbridge, MA (via Albany NY) 1 ½ hrs total drive
	Hiking in Ice Glen and Laura’s Tower?

------------ We can stop, and fly home from Albany -----------
OR choose one of these possibilities:

There is a LOT to do and see in upstate New York.  Explore the Finger Lakes area and towns.  As well, there are a LOT of things to do and see in Massachusetts. Staying in NY, I imagine we would still want to fly out of Albany.  If we go on through MA, we can fly back from Boston.  We could also dip south a bit and hit Connecticut and Rhode Island and fly out around there—it’ll just take more time.  I’ll let you choose how we will end this!

***We can also take a trip elsewhere, like the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky…
or,  a Southern Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri kind of thing…or I could come to the west coast and we could go north…but you’ve done that already, right?

I’m open to anything.
